## 📁 Project Structure

📦 video-trailer-popup
┣ 📂 images/
┃ ┣ 📄 thumbnail.jpg ← Thumbnail image shown on the page
┃ ┗ 📄 video.mp4 ← Trailer video file
┣ 📄 index.html ← Main HTML structure
┣ 📄 style.css ← Styling for layout and popup

## ▶️ How It Works

1. The main container shows a thumbnail, title, and a “Watch now” button.
2. When clicked, it triggers the `.trailer-container` popup with the video player.
3. The close icon (`X`) hides the popup, **pauses** the video, and **resets** playback to the beginning.
4. Mobile-responsive layout ensures it works beautifully on smaller screens too.
